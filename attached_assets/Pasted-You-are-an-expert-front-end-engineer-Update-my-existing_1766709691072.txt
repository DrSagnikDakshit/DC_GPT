You are an expert front-end engineer. Update my existing Home screen to match the following D-COUTURE layout and behavior. Keep the rest of the project unchanged.

GOAL: Luxury, editorial, minimal “almost empty” home screen with a subtle top bar, centered manifesto text, and a bottom CTA that toggles into two options.

REQUIREMENTS (UI)
1) Top bar (always visible)
- Left: “D-COUTURE” in small caps (or visually small uppercase) with subtle letter spacing.
- Right: a simple profile dot (a small filled circle). No icon inside.

2) Main canvas (almost empty)
- Centered vertically and horizontally:
  - Large text: “D-COUTURE” (ALL CAPS, wide letter spacing)
  - Subtext (two lines, keep line break):
    “Style is not about following trends—
    it’s about knowing yourself”
  - Philosophy marker (two lines, subtle, below subtext):
    “Identity over Trends
     Structure over Chaos”

3) Bottom action area (two states)
STATE A (default):
- Single bottom button: “Begin Experience”

STATE B (after clicking “Begin Experience”):
- Replace the single button with two stacked buttons:
  - Primary: “Enter Your Wardrobe”
  - Secondary: “Curate Today’s Look”

IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR
- Clicking “Begin Experience” must NOT navigate or change the page.
- The background + top bar + centered text must stay exactly the same.
- Only the bottom action area changes from STATE A to STATE B.
- Add a subtle transition (fade/slide) ONLY for the button swap, not the whole page.
- No scrolling on this screen; it should fit full viewport height and respect mobile safe areas.

STYLING
- Mobile-first PWA look. Clean, couture-grade.
- Choose ONE of these backgrounds:
  Option 1: near-black (#0B0B0B) with off-white text
  Option 2: warm off-white (#F6F4F1) with near-black text
Pick whichever matches the existing theme best.
- Avoid gradients, busy shadows, imagery, carousels.
- Use generous spacing, calm typography, slightly muted subtext/marker (reduced opacity).
- Buttons should be full-width, rounded, subtle (thin border or muted fill). No icons.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Implement this as a state toggle in the Home component (e.g., useState).
- Keep any existing routing intact; do not add new routes.
- Wire the two new buttons to placeholder handlers for now (e.g., console.log or TODO comments), but DO NOT remove existing logic—just adapt it so future navigation can be added later.
- Make sure it works on iPhone-sized screens and desktop (centered, responsive).

DELIVERABLE
- Modify the existing Home screen file(s) accordingly and show me the updated code.
- If you need to create small reusable components (e.g., TopBar), do so locally in the same folder.

Now implement these changes.
