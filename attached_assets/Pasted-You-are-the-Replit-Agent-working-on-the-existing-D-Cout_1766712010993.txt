You are the Replit Agent working on the existing D-Couture MVP. Your task is to update ONLY the PWA homepage to include a premium, luxury-feeling feature section with one-line feature statements, while preserving all existing functionality and routes.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do NOT change backend logic, database schema, API response shapes, or the outfit generation algorithm.
- Do NOT add new core features. This is a homepage UI/content update only.
- Keep the current color scheme, and add subtle accents of wine red and royal green (sparingly) without changing the overall luxury palette.
- Mobile-first, calm, premium UI. No clutter, no gimmicks.

HOMEPAGE REQUIREMENTS:
1) Add a hero line that includes the phrase: “Personalized stylizing for everyday and every-body.”
   - It must feel premium and confident, not salesy.
   - Place it prominently near the  features section. 

2) Add a “Features” section on the homepage using ONE-LINE feature statements (no paragraphs).
   - These must be visually elegant: simple list or cards, generous whitespace, high-quality typography.

Use EXACT one-line features (verbatim, as written below):
- Today’s Couture — A considered outfit decision for today, with one elevated alternative.
- Why It Works — A concise explanation grounded in color, form, and context.
- Aesthetic Health — A quiet signal of how coherent your style is over time.
- Wardrobe Intelligence — A structured view of what you own and how it works together.
- Ask by Text or WhatsApp — Request an outfit decision whenever you need one.
- Recent Decisions — A light record of past selections to maintain continuity.
- Reflection — A moment to note how your style felt, not how it performed.

3) Add clear CTAs (buttons) aligned with current routing:
- Primary CTA: “Today’s Couture” → route to /today
- Secondary CTA: “Wardrobe Intelligence” → route to /wardrobe

4) Add a subtle “Concierge” micro-module (small, understated) showing:
- “Ask by Text / WhatsApp”
- A short line: “Send the occasion. Receive a decision.”
- If a phone number is available in env (e.g., VITE_CONCIERGE_NUMBER), display it; otherwise show “Connect in Settings” (do not implement settings).

DESIGN / UI STYLE:
- Must look premium and luxury.
- Keep existing screenshot-based style and layout as much as possible.
- Use wine red + royal green only for small accents (e.g., icon, chip, divider, hover state).
- Typography: elegant serif headings + clean sans body (use existing fonts; if none, add tasteful Google Fonts).
- Use subtle transitions (fade/hover) but no flashy animations.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Create/adjust reusable components only if necessary (e.g., FeatureRow, FeatureCard).
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely required.
- Ensure homepage remains fast and clean.

DELIVERABLES:
After implementing, output:
1) Summary of homepage changes
2) Files changed
3) Commands to run (npm run dev)
4) Manual test checklist:
   - Homepage renders correctly on mobile width
   - CTAs navigate to /today and /wardrobe
   - Features section displays exactly the one-line items above
   - Concierge module renders with/without env var
