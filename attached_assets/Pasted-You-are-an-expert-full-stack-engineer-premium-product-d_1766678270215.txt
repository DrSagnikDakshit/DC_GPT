You are an expert full-stack engineer + premium product designer building an MVP PWA called “D-Couture” (aesthetic operating system). This is NOT a shopping app, NOT a trend app, NOT a chatbot stylist.

GOAL (MVP):
Build a premium-feeling installable PWA + minimal backend that:
1) Lets the user add garments (photo optional; start with manual structured entry)
2) Stores garments as structured objects
3) Computes a simple wardrobe pairing graph (compatibility scores)
4) Generates “Today’s Couture” (1–3 deterministic outfits + 1 elevated variant) using scoring rules (color harmony, silhouette balance, context fit, novelty)
5) Produces an LLM explanation layer that ONLY narrates decisions (never chooses garments)
6) Collects feedback (worn? how it felt?) and shows an “Aesthetic Health” signal (simple MVP metric)

PRODUCT PRINCIPLES:
- Identity > trends
- Structure > infinite choices
- Deterministic planning decides; LLM explains
- PAM (Personal Aesthetic Model) updates slowly (weekly in future; MVP can simulate)
- Premium luxury look: calm, minimal, high-contrast typography, generous spacing, subtle motion
- Customer retention: daily ritual (“Today’s Couture”), streak/consistency without gamification, gentle reminders, progress signal (“Aesthetic Health”), but no addictive feeds.

TECH CONSTRAINTS (Replit-friendly):
- Use a monorepo with:
  /apps/web  (React + Vite + Tailwind + PWA)
  /apps/api  (Node.js + Fastify or Express)
- Use SQLite for MVP (Prisma ORM) so it runs in Replit without external DB.
- Provide an .env.example
- Add seed script for demo garments.
- All features must run with one command at repo root: npm run dev
- Include simple unit tests OR at least a test checklist per milestone.

DELIVERABLES:
You must build in small milestones. After EACH milestone, you MUST output:
1) What you implemented (brief)
2) Files changed/added
3) Commands to run
4) Manual test checklist
5) Known limitations (if any)

MILESTONE PLAN (DO IN ORDER):
M1) Project scaffold + premium UI shell + API health check
M2) Garment CRUD (manual entry) + clean wardrobe list UI
M3) Wardrobe compatibility scoring + store edges + visualize compatibility (simple)
M4) Outfit generator endpoint + “Today’s Couture” page (deterministic) + elevated variant
M5) LLM explanation endpoint (locked-down prompt) + explanation UI
M6) Feedback capture + “Aesthetic Health” metric + lightweight retention UI (daily ritual)

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS (PREMIUM LUXURY):
- Color palette: monochrome base (black/white) with ONE accent color used sparingly (gold-like tone but not tacky)
- Typography: elegant serif for headings + clean sans for body (use Google Fonts)
- Components: glassy cards, subtle shadows, rounded corners, lots of whitespace
- Microinteractions: subtle hover, press, fade/slide transitions (no flashy animations)
- Layout: mobile-first; feels like a luxury brand companion
- Copy tone: concise, couture-like, not salesy (“Today’s Couture”, “Wardrobe Intelligence”, “Aesthetic Health”)

RETENTION + MARKETING (WITHOUT CHEAP TRICKS):
- On home screen: a calm hero section describing the value proposition in 1–2 lines.
- A “Daily Couture” ritual entry point with a date stamp.
- A light “progress” module: aesthetic health trend (even if mocked first).
- A “Why” explanation section under each outfit (the LLM narration).
- NO shopping links, NO trends feed, NO infinite scroll.

SCORING LOGIC (MVP SIMPLE BUT EXPLAINABLE):
- Each garment has: category, color_family, formality(0–1), silhouette, season(optional)
- Compatibility score between two garments:
  0.4*colorHarmony + 0.3*formalityMatch + 0.3*silhouetteBalance
- Outfit score aggregates pairwise compatibility + context fit + novelty penalty
- Provide a score breakdown per outfit in UI.

LLM EXPLANATION (SAFE + CONTROLLED):
- The LLM receives ONLY structured JSON: outfit items + score breakdown + PAM traits (MVP can be fixed defaults).
- It must generate couture-style reasoning explaining WHY the outfit works.
- It must NEVER suggest alternative purchases or additional items.
- If OpenAI key missing, fallback to a deterministic template explanation.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not bloat. No auth required for MVP; use a single demo user.
- Keep code clean and commented.
- Do not introduce unused abstractions.
- Do not change earlier milestones unless necessary to fix a bug.

Start now with M1. Build the scaffold and premium UI shell first.
